STROKE PREDICTION 

Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive system to estimate the likelihood of stroke
occurrence in individuals, based on health and lifestyle factors. The aim is to build a machine
learning model that can support early detection and prevention efforts in healthcare. By analyzing
patient records, the system identifies key risk factors and provides quick predictions, which can
be helpful for awareness and medical consultations.


Features

Real-time Prediction: Predicts stroke risk based on user-provided data instantly.

Interactive UI: Utilizes a Streamlit app for easy user input and interaction.

Comprehensive Features: Incorporates key health metrics like age, BMI, glucose level, and medical history (hypertension, heart disease) for prediction.

Interpretable Results: Provides clear, understandable predictions based on a robust machine learning model.
